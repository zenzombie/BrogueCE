The seed catalog now contains more information, including items carried by 
monsters, shackled vs. caged status for captive monsters, and which vault a 
key will open. For concision, gold is aggregated per level, the extraneous 
'+0' removed from non-enchanted weapons, and armor no longer shows the rating 
or strength requirement. Lastly, added legendary allies and both resurrection 
and commutation altars.
